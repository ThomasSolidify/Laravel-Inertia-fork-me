Laravel-Inertia Personal Starter Kit
This repository serves as my personal starting point for creating web applications using Laravel, Inertia, and Vue.js. It's tailored to streamline my workflow and integrates a combination of technologies that I find most effective for building modern, dynamic web apps.

About This Starter Kit
The core of this starter kit is Laravel, a powerful and elegant web application framework. It simplifies common tasks encountered in most web projects, making development a more enjoyable and productive experience. Laravel's features such as an expressive database ORM, simple routing, and robust background job processing are part of this kit.

Inertia.js is integrated to bridge the gap between Laravel and Vue.js. It allows me to build single-page applications without the complexity of a full frontend framework. This setup provides the smoothness of a SPA with the simplicity and robustness of server-driven apps.

Vue.js is included for its reactive components and an approachable syntax, which makes it a great choice for building dynamic user interfaces.
